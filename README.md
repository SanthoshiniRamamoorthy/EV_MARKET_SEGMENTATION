# EV MARKET SEGMENTATION
In the ever-expanding landscape of electric vehicles (EVs), market segmentation plays a pivotal role in understanding the diverse factors influencing consumer preferences and behaviors. This study employs sophisticated data analysis and visualization techniques to comprehensively segment the electric vehicle market. Leveraging a multifaceted dataset that encompasses both vehicle specifications and buyer behavior attributes, the analysis provides a holistic view of the EV market. Vehicle specification segmentation explores factors such as acceleration time, top speed, range, efficiency, and charging capabilities, employing machine learning clustering techniques to identify distinct categories. Concurrently, buyer behavior segmentation considers demographic and socio-economic factors, including profession, marital status, education, and financial indicators, offering insights into consumer preferences. The integration of these dual perspectives provides a nuanced understanding of how specific EV features resonate with diverse consumer groups.
